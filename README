LogCluster 0.03

Introduction
------------
LogCluster is a clustering tool which mines line patterns from textual event
logs, so that each pattern represents a detected cluster.
LogCluster has been written in Perl and has been tested on Linux, but it
should run on any platform with a recent Perl distribution. It requires
Getopt::Long and Digest::MD5 Perl modules which are included in the standard 
Perl installation on Linux.
